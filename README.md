# CS410-Website
Repository for my website for PSU's CS410 Web Design Class.
You can run the code using VSCode by cloning or downloading the repo manually,
and pressing run on the index.html file. 

OR, you can visit the website for the site: https://xylongyx.github.io/CS410-Website/
to see what it looks like as well.

I used the documentation for Bootstrap to make the navbar: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/? 
to try and get a collapsable navbar.

The website however, is a lot of basic CSS and HTML put together and using https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp
for things that I did not know how to do or couldn't remember how to do correctly.
